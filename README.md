# conrod_hello_world
Hello world using Conrod lib
Conrod version: 0.61.1

Rewrite of conrod's hello world example (Using winit for windows && glium as rendering interface)
(https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/conrod/blob/master/examples/hello_world.rs).

It's all but idiomatic code since I'm completly new to Rust.

Conrod's licenses apply.

Feel free to improve/share.
